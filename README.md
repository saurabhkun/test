## 💡 The Solapur Disconnect
Currently, **60% of everyday civic issues** (like potholes and road cracks) go unreported because the process is too complex. Furthermore, **75% of citizens** are unsure which specific municipal department is responsible for their issue.

**Rashmirathi** solves this by creating a unified, AI-driven ecosystem. We use **Google Gemini AI** to automatically analyze images, detect the severity of road damage, and route the complaint to the exact SMC department required—while rewarding active citizens with **Tax Concessions**.

### 🔄 The Workflow (Zero Friction)

| **Step 1: SNAP 📸** | **Step 2: AI SORT 🤖** | **Step 3: SCRUTINY 🔍** | **Step 4: REWARD 🏆** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Citizen** takes a photo of the road damage. GPS is auto-tagged via the mobile app. | **Gemini AI** analyzes the image, assigns priority, and auto-routes it to the correct SMC Dept. | **Scrutiny Officer** verifies the site, and the **Contractor** executes the repair with an audit trail. | **Citizen** is notified of the resolution and earns points towards **Property Tax Concessions**. |

## 📲 How to Test the Prototype

We have provided a compiled APK for immediate testing on any Android device, bypassing the need for local Flutter compilation.

1. **Download the App:** Click the **[Download Android APK](#)** button at the top of this page.
2. **Install:** Allow "Install from Unknown Sources" on your Android device if prompted.
3. **Login:** Use the provided test credentials in our video demo, or register a new citizen account.
4. **Web Dashboard:** Access the [Admin Dashboard Here](#) to view the real-time heatmap of reports generated by the app.

## 🏛️ The 3-Pillar Ecosystem

Our platform connects three distinct user groups to ensure efficiency and eliminate corruption.

### 1. 👥 For Citizens (Reporting & Gamification)
* **📸 One-Tap Reporting:** Effortless issue submission with photo capture, precise GPS location tagging, and AI-assisted descriptions.
* **📍 Real-Time Tracking:** Transparent updates (Reported → Verified → Resolved) so citizens know their voice is heard.
* **💰 Tax Concession Rewards:** Users earn verified tokens for accurate road damage reports, redeemable as municipal tax benefits.

### 2. 🏢 For Municipal Departments (AI Automation)
* **🤖 Smart Dept Allocation:** Uses **Gemini Vision AI** to detect issue types and auto-routes them, completely eliminating manual ticket sorting.
* **🔥 Priority Heatmaps:** The web dashboard visualizes high-severity zones, allowing SMC to allocate budgets proactively rather than reactively.
* **🛡️ Scrutiny Layer:** Dedicated portal for the Scrutiny Officer to conduct site surveys and approve contractor work before funds are released.

### 3. 👷 For Contractors (Accountability)
* **💼 Direct Allocation:** Access a transparent, curated list of SMC-approved civic projects requiring rapid resolution.
* **📸 Proof of Work:** Contractors must upload geo-tagged "After" photos to close a ticket, ensuring high-quality, long-lasting repairs.

## 📈 Why This Wins (The Data)
Based on our primary research survey of **2,300+ data points** and global municipal reports:

* 🔴 **92%** of respondents prefer reporting issues via a mobile app over visiting a ward office.
* 🔴 **65%** are dissatisfied with the speed and feedback of current redressal systems.
* 🔴 **85%** of urban Indians own a smartphone, enabling mobile-first reporting.
* 🟢 **The Impact:** Automating the triage process saves thousands of administrative hours for SMC and ensures dangerous road conditions are fixed before accidents happen.
